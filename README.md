A frontend widget that I want to use to track live "to catch a predator" type channels on the internet.

mvp core features is:
- gql subscriptions for live changes
- web notifications
- paginated channels (if there are that many streamers) 
- easy deploy. just needs to display live statuses of channels. (html server side instead?)
- plan to add this widget as a prop for a forum
